Skydiving is parachuting Skydiving from an airplane for fun. Skydiving can be done for individually and with groups of people. Training is required. Unlike most paratroopers, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute. The balloon jump can also be made from a helicopter or a balloon that is high enough in the sky. Skydiving can be an exciting sport.
